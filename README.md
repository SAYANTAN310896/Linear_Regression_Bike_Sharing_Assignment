# Linear-Regression-Bike-Sharing-Assignment
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. 
Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, 
and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

After covid pendemic company Boombikes has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, 
and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

Our objective is to help the BoomBikes to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. 
Help them understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends basically the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the 
American market. 
Explain the following things :
•	Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
•	How well those variables describe the bike demands


We are using the day.csv file and data_dictionary to understand what each column signifies.

## Conclusions
1. Company should focus on expanding business during Summer and Winter.
2. Company should focus on expanding business during September.
3. Company should focus on expanding business on normal working day and weekend only sat.                  
4. The company have more rental count in 2019 compared to 2018. That means over the year more people have noticed the company. The company should spend more on the promotion through digital media or social media . So that they can get more customers.
5. There would be less bookings during. Holiday : People like to spend time with family or take rest.
6. hum : People don't like humid weather
7. mnth_jan and mnth_july : People don't like to rent in these months . As for Jan its just after the christmas hence people don't like it but july is the monsoon , people don't like to rent on monsoon.
8. Light_snowrain and Misty : People don't like these weather.
